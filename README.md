## Description

Contract Schema unifies disparate I/O layers under one authoritative contract. A single, versioned JSON file defines both the permissible inputs and the required outputs; the library takes care of CLI generation, default handling, deep validation, and rich, provenance-aware output documents.

* **Input parsing:** Every field in the contract automatically becomes an `argparse` flag, a JSON key, and a CLI flag, with type enforcement, enums, and sensible defaults injected.  
* **Output construction:** The same contract defines the structure of your result document. A helper class injects run metadata, hashes inputs and findings for auditability, and captures execution environment details.  
* **Meta-schema validation:** A bundled _meta-schema_ ensures every contract you write contains the minimal top-level keys (`title`, `version`, `description`, `input`, `output`) and that both `input` and `output` sections themselves declare a `fields` block. Contract mistakes are caught at load time.  
* **No heavy dependencies:** Only the Python standard library (>= 3.8) is required. `pandas` is optional and used only when you pass a DataFrame directly as an input.  

The result is a single source of truth for I/O that works anywhere Python runs: CI pipelines, air-gapped analysis workstations, or serverless functions.

## Dependencies

* **Required:** Python >= 3.8  

No other external packages are needed.

## Installation

```
pip install contract-schema
```

## Usage

Check out `example_analytic.py` and `example_model.py` for detailed examples of Contract Schema in action.

## Background and Motivation

Security analytics, ML pipelines, and data engineering jobs often reinvent the wheel for argument parsing and result emission. Over time, field names diverge, validation drifts, and downstream systems break.

Contract Schema solves this by treating the contract itself as code--version-controlled, validated, and consumed at runtime.

* Uniformity - All tools speak the same language defined by the contract.
* Reliability - Inputs and outputs are validated deeply; failures happen fast and loudly.
* Traceability - Documents include run IDs, environment snapshots, and SHA-256 hashes of both inputs and outputs.
* Extensibility - Write new contracts (e.g., for data ingestion) and they instantly get CLI generation, validation, and output helpers-no new code needed.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome from all, regardless of rank or position.

There are no system requirements for contributing to this project. To contribute via the web:

1. Click GitLab's "Web IDE" button to open the online editor.
2. Make your changes. **Note:** limit your changes to one part of one file per commit; for example, edit only the "Description" section here in the first commit, then the "Background and Motivation" section in a separate commit.
3. Once finished, click the blue "Commit..." button.
4. Write a detailed description of the changes you made in the "Commit Message" box.
5. Select the "Create a new branch" radio button if you do not already have your own branch; otherwise, select your branch. The recommended naming convention for new branches is ``first.middle.last``.
6. Click the green "Commit" button.
