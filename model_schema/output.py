"""Provides high-level helpers for creating and saving model artifacts.

This module contains the primary user-facing components for generating a
model manifest and persisting it alongside the serialized model. It offers:

- `ModelManifest`: A dictionary subclass that acts as a builder for creating a
  structured, valid manifest. It simplifies the process by automatically
  populating complex fields like the execution environment and file hashes.
- `save_model()`: A convenience function that handles the entire process of
  pickling a model, creating its corresponding manifest, and saving both
  artifacts to disk with consistent naming.

The module relies on standard library features and `importlib.metadata` for
dependency capture, making it portable and suitable for various environments.
